The short gnome was a striking figure, with his pale complexion and deep blue eyes that seemed to sparkle even in the dimmest light. His dark auburn hair was usually kept short and tidy, framing his face in a way that drew attention to his stunning eyes.

He was often seen wearing dark glasses, which he used to hide his glass eye, a constant reminder of the danger and violence he had left behind. His attire was a mishmash of styles, combining a flat cap with tattered armor and an assassin's hooded robe. It was clear that he had seen some tough times and had been forced to improvise with whatever he had on hand.

He could often be found busking on street corners and inns to earn his keep
